The following instances belong to [1] based on a dataset of real preferences produced by Toshihiro Kamishima [2].

Each file constains the same ranked-based ground truth: 5,000 people were asked to rank 10 types of sushis [2].

There are two types of instances:
type 1 - TOP 3: We trim each of the 5,000 preference lists to only retain the top 3 sushis for that individual. If the offer set S does not contain any of the top 3 choices, the individual would choose 0.
type 2 - TOP 5: We trim each of the 5,000 preference lists to only retain the top 5 sushis for that individual. If the offer set S does not contain any of the top 5 choices, the individual would choose 0.

(Note: The lists appear in full, but the no-purchase alternative appears in position 4 under type 1 (top 3) and in position 6 under type 2 (top 5)).

Each of the 5,000 preference lists (counting repetitions) has a weight of 0.01% (adding to a total of 50% Market share)
The remaining 50% of the weight is associated to an ficticious agent who always chooses the no-purchase alternative.


An instance is composed of two parts:

Part 1: Ground Truth
- Products: An enumeration of all the products
- Ranked lists: An enumeration of the preference lists l1, .., lm
- Betas: The probability associated to each preference list p2, .., pm. The probability for the first list is p1 = 1 - p2 - .. - pm

Part 2: Transactions
Each transaction is composed of an assortment of products and a product chosen (If product 0 is chosen it means nothing was purchased).
Transactions are grouped into:
- In-sample transactions: Used to train the models.
- Out of Sample transactions: Used to test the models. This is not needed if one uses the soft-RMSE across ALL assortments. In our paper, we don't use this information.

The revenues associated with each product are:

Product    Revenue

1          1.838419913
