Each file constains a generalized stochastic preference instance in JSON format. An instance is composed of two parts:

Part 1: Ground Truth
- Choices: The index associated to each list. 
An index of 0 always chooses the no-purchase. 
An index = 1 means the consumer takes the list as a standard preference order.
An index = 2 means the consumer has a behaviour that falls outside the RUM class.
- Products: An enumeration of all the products
- Ranked lists: An enumeration of the lists l1, .., lm
- Betas: The probability associated to each preference list p2, .., pm. The probability for the first list is p1 = 1 - p2 - .. - pm

Part 2: Transactions
Each transaction is composed of an assortment of products and a product chosen (If product 0 is chosen it means nothing was purchased).
Transactions are grouped into:
- In-sample transactions: Used to train the models.
- Out of Sample transactions: Used to test the models. This is not needed if one uses the soft-RMSE across ALL assortments. In our paper, we don't use this information.

The revenues associated with each product are:

Product     Revenue
0           0.0
1           4.69
2           8.99
3           14.99
4           9.99
5           15.99
6           13.99
7           10.99
8           14.99
9           15.99
10          9.99
