These synthetic instances are from the paper:

Each file constains a stochastic preference instance in JSON format. An instance is composed of two parts:

Part 1: Ground Truth
- Products: An enumeration of all the products
- Ranked lists: An enumeration of the preference lists l1, .., lm
- Betas: The probability associated to each preference list p2, .., pm. The probability for the first list is p1 = 1 - p2 - .. - pm

Part 2: Transactions
Each transaction is composed of an assortment of products and a product chosen (If product 0 is chosen it means nothing was purchased).
Transactions are grouped into:
- In-sample transactions: Used to train the models.
- Out of Sample transactions: Used to test the models. This is not needed if one uses the soft-RMSE across ALL assortments. In our paper, we don't use this information.
