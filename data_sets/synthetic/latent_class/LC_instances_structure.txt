Each file constains a latent class instance in JSON format. An instance is composed of two parts:

Part 1: Ground Truth
- Products: An enumeration of all the products
- Gammas: The weight of each class, they sum up to one.
- Multinomial logit models: one model for each of the k classes, each model has a list "etas". The ith position of "etas" contains the value of exp(Vi) where Vi is the nominal utility of the ith product. We assume V0=0 for the no purchase.

Part 2: Transactions
Each transaction is composed of an assortment of products and a product chosen (If product 0 is chosen it means nothing was purchased).
Transactions are grouped into:
- In-sample transactions: Used to train the models.
- Out of Sample transactions: Used to test the models. This is not needed if one uses the soft-RMSE across ALL assortments. In our paper, we don't use this information.
