Each file constains a nested logit instance in JSON format. An instance is composed of two parts:

Part 1: Ground Truth
- Products: An enumeration of all the products
- Etas: The independent term of the nominal utility for each product, normalized to get a 50% market share.
- Nests: Each nest contains
	- The products that belong to the nest
	- Lambda parameter: the degree of dissimilarity of products in nest
	- Price sensitivity of the nest 

Part 2: Transactions
Each transaction is composed of an assortment of products, the prices for each product in order and a product chosen (If product 0 is chosen it means nothing was purchased).
Transactions are grouped into:
- In-sample transactions: Used to train the models.
- Out of Sample transactions: Used to test the models. This is not needed if one uses the soft-RMSE across ALL assortments. In our paper, we don't use this information.
